/**
 * @mainpage sleepd
 * 
 * @section summary Summary
 * 
 * Open webOS component to manage device suspend-resume cycles.
 * 
 * @section description Description
 * 
 * Sleepd is one of the important daemons started when webOS boots. It is
 * responsible for scheduling platform sleeps as soon as it is idle, so that we
 * see optimum battery performance. To achieve this it keeps polling on the
 * system to see if any of the other services or processes need the platform
 * running, and if not it sends the suspend message to all these components (so
 * that they can finish whatever they are doing ASAP and suspend). Sleepd then
 * lets the kernel know that the platform is ready to sleep. Once an interrupt
 * (such as key press) has woken the platform up, sleepd lets the entire system
 * know that the platform is up and running so that all the activities can
 * resume.
 * 
 * Sleepd also manages the RTC alarms on the system by maintaining a SQlite
 * database for all the requested alarms.
 * 
 * @section code-organization Code Organization
 * 
 * The code for sleepd is organized into two main categories:
 * 
 * - A bunch of individual power watcher modules which tie into the service bus
 *   and react to IPC messages passed in and/or which start their own threads
 *   and run separately.
 * 
 * - A central module initialization system which ties them all together and
 *   handles all of the bookkeeping to keep them all running and gracefully shut
 *   them down when the sleepd service is asked to stop.
 * 
 * Documentation for each of the power management modules is available in the
 * section to the left entitled "Modules".
 * 
 * The modules each register themselves with the main initialization code using
 * a macro called {@link INIT_FUNC}.  It uses GCC-specific functionality to
 * run hook registration code when the binary is being loaded into memory.  As a
 * result, all of the code to register these hooks is run before {@link main()}
 * is called.  This creates a very modular code organizational approach in which
 * new power saving modules can be added independently of the main
 * initialization system.

 * Main entry point for sleepd - runs the initialization hooks installed at program load time
 * 
 * A bit counter-intuitively, this is not the first part of this program which
 * is run.
 * 
 * First, everything which uses the {@link INIT_FUNC} macro in init.h are run,
 * which registers a bunch of hooks with the initialization system so that
 * individual modules can be registered without touching the main sleepd
 * initialization code.  Then, once all of those hooks are installed, execution
 * proceeds to this function which actually runs those hooks.
 * 
 * - Initializes sleepd.
 * - Attaches as a Luna service under com.palm.sleep.
 * - Attaches to Nyx.
 * - Subscribes to events related to the charger being plugged and unplugged from the com.palm.power service.
 * - Calls {@link TheOneInit()} to finish initialization of the service.
 * - Issues a request to the com.palm.power service to check on the plugged/unplugged status of the charger.
 * 
 * @param	argc		Number of command-line arguments.
 * @param	argv		List of command-line arguments.
 * 
 * @todo Move the logging initialization functionality into {@link TheOneInit()}.
